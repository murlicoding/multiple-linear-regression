Multiple Linear Regression Project
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of Multiple Linear Regression, a supervised machine learning algorithm used to predict a dependent variable based on two or more independent variables. The model helps analyze how multiple factors collectively influence an outcome.
